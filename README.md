# All India Weather

Now a days its is difficlt to predict the temperature, it changes frequently. Our present forecast gives a centralized temperature at a perticular node. So, by this we cannot get the accurate temperature. To overcome this and to give a accurate temperature, humidity at each and every corner of the city. 

We want to solve the major issue by designing a decentralized network nodes which collects temperature,humidity at a regular intervals of time and uploads it in server. To achieve this we gonna develope a node to node netowrk.
> For Example: Suppose there is a district which consist of 10 mandals, each mandal is a node(node generates data of temperature & humidity at a perticular mandal). On the whole, for a district we get 10 nodes on the avg of these 10 nodes a new data of temperature and humidity is generated. Similarly there is a state which consist of 10 districts, on the whole, for a state we get 10 district nodes of data. A new data of temperature and humidity is generated at a perticular state. So on..

We gonna develop a friendly weather system were a common man can also use the facility. Like the generated data is visualized in the form of graphs. These graphs can actually predict the weather and we can compare the actual, present and predicted data.

Now a days its hard to know the different villages temperature which far from yours
